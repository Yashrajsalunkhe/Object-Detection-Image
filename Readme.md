🖼️ Object Detection Image

An end-to-end web application that allows users to upload images and receive annotated results with detected objects using a YOLOv5 model. The system comprises a React frontend and a Flask backend, facilitating seamless object detection and visualization.

🚀 Features

    Image Upload: Users can upload images through the web interface.

    Object Detection: Utilizes a YOLOv5 model to detect and classify objects within the uploaded images.

    Annotated Results: Returns images with bounding boxes and labels indicating detected objects.

    Responsive Frontend: Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

    Backend API: Flask-based API handles image processing and model inference.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS

    Backend: Flask, PyTorch, YOLOv5

    Model: Pre-trained YOLOv5 model (yolov5mu.pt)

    Others: PostCSS, ESLint

⚙️ Installation
Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

    cd backend

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask server:

    python server.py

The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

    cd frontend

Install dependencies:

    npm install

Start the development server:

    npm run dev

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

🧪 How It Works

    Image Upload: Users upload an image through the React frontend.

    API Request: The image is sent to the Flask backend via a POST request.

    Object Detection: The backend processes the image using the YOLOv5 model and generates an annotated image with detected objects.

    Response: The annotated image is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

📈 Future Enhancements

    Real-Time Detection: Extend functionality to support real-time object detection via webcam.

    Model Selection: Allow users to choose between different YOLO models or custom-trained models.

    Performance Optimization: Implement caching and optimize model loading for faster inference.
